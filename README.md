## Better Than Trello

## About
Better than Trello is a project management tool that allows the user to manage and organize their projects. We built Better than Trello over 2-3 days where we used Ruby on Rails for the back end, and React on the front end. It was built through 3 phrases where we designed the schema, utilized the React library for state management of the Virtual DOM, and implemented features to establish relationships between react components.

## Technologies

* Frontend: React, React-Router Dom, Semantic UI, CSS
* Backend: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Serializers

## Features

### Creating, Reading, Updating, Deleting a Project
    In order to create a new project, we set up a form where the user can enter project details, and upon submit, the details will be transferred over to the list of projects currently queued. The user is able to click on the specific project to review, edit, or add any notes specific to the project. Upon completion of the project, the specific project will be moved onto another list.

### Browse, Search, and Sort
    These features were set up in order to maintain the scalibility of the app. Instead of browsing through the list of projects, users can enter certain keywords to search for a specific project that they are managing. Users can also sort their projects by name Ascending order.

## Future Features
    Some possible features in the feature upcoming would be to implement drag and drop upon completion of a project, and expand on the sorting feature either by date or priority.

## Credits
